h1. lighthouse_cli

A quick command line interface to lighthouse. The goal is to reduce overhead of tracking tickets inline with normal workflow. The effect is achieved by setting conventions.

h2. Install

Add github to gem sources unless you've done that before

    sudo gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
    sudo gem install maxim-lighthouse_cli
    

h2. Usage

1. Create Lhcfile in your project with the following yaml content (either user/pass or token, no need for both):
  
  <pre language="yaml">
    <code>
      account:
        example_account
      project:
        example_project
      # username:
      #   foo
      # password:
      #   bar
      # token:
      #   baz
    </code>
  </pre>

2. Add Lhcfile to .gitignore (avoid committing your token/password).
3. Run lh help to get started.
